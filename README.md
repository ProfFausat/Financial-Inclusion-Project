# v2 – Production-Ready Financial Inclusion Project

## Business Objective
Develop a predictive model to identify the top 20% of unbanked individuals
most likely to open a bank account if targeted with a mobile banking
awareness campaign. Success will be measured by an improvement in
marketing outreach efficiency (conversion rate vs. control group).

## Project Goals
- Build a reproducible, production-grade ML pipeline
- Perform systematic, defensible feature selection from all available data
- Ensure preprocessing and modeling are scalable and robust
- Evaluate model performance in a business context (precision, recall, ROI)
- Provide explainable predictions using SHAP and fairness auditing

## Key Deliverables
- Final serialized ML pipeline (.pkl) ready for deployment
- Clear documentation of preprocessing, features, and model decisions
- Business-oriented evaluation metrics and threshold analysis
- Comprehensive Jupyter Notebook (`notebooks/Financial_Inclusion_Project_v2.ipynb`) handling end-to-end workflow: raw data ingestion, cleaning, feature selection, and modeling
- Final serialized ML pipeline (`notebooks/svm_unbanked_pipeline.pkl`) ready for loading
